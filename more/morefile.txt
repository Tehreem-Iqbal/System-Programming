MORE(1)                                                            User Commands                                                           MORE(1)

NAME
       more - file perusal filter for crt viewing

SYNOPSIS
       more [options] file...

DESCRIPTION
       more is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.  This version is especially primitive.  Users should realize that less(1)
       provides more(1) emulation plus extensive enhancements.

OPTIONS
       Options are also taken from the environment variable MORE (make sure to precede them with a dash (-)) but command-line options  will  over‚Äê
       ride those.

       -d, --silent
              Prompt  with "[Press space to continue, 'q' to quit.]", and display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]" instead of ringing the bell when
              an illegal key is pressed.

       -l, --logical
              Do not pause after any line containing a ^L (form feed).

       -f, --no-pause
              Count logical lines, rather than screen lines (i.e., long lines are not folded).

       -p, --print-over
              Do not scroll.  Instead, clear the whole screen and then display the text.  Notice that this option is switched on automatically  if
              the executable is named page.

       -c, --clean-print
              Do not scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing the remainder of each line as it is displayed.
