/*
This version add the functionality of adding an if control structure
in your shell. The if control structure works as follows:
● The shell runs the command that follows the key word if
● The shell checks the exit status of the command
● An exit status of 0 means success, nonzero means failure
● The shell executes commands after the then line if success
● The shell executes commands after the else line if failure
● The keyword fi marks the end of if block
